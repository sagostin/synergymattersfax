# Synergy Matters Fax Server

Synergy Matters Fax Server is designed to facilitate fax sending with a robust architecture that comprises a main fax service and an integrated SFTP server (SFTPGo) for managing fax file transfers.

## Architecture Overview

- **Main Fax Service:** Runs as a systemd service on the host. It handles fax processing and webhook integrations.
- **SFTP Server (SFTPGo):** Managed via Docker Compose, providing FTP/SFTP access for fax file storage and transfers.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux system with systemd support.
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (if building directly) or Docker (if using Docker for building).
- Docker and Docker Compose (for the SFTPGo service).
- Ensure required ports are open:
  - SFTPGo Web Interface: 8081
  - FTP: 21
  - Passive Ports: 50000-50100

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sagostin/synergymattersfax.git
cd synergymattersfax
```

### 2. Build the Main Fax Service

You have two options to build the main service binary:

#### Option A: Build on the Host
Ensure Go (v1.24.1 or later) is installed and run:
```bash
go build -o synergymatters_fax .
```
Then move the binary to your deployment directory (e.g., `/home/ubuntu/synergymattersfax`).

#### Option B: Build via Docker
Run the build script:
```bash
sudo ./build.sh
```
Extract the built binary, rename it to `synergymatters_fax`, and place it in `/home/ubuntu/synergymattersfax`.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the repository root (or in your deployment directory) with the following content. Adjust the values as needed:
```env
FTP_ROOT=./synergyfax_ftp
FAX_NUMBER=TEN_DIGIT_NUMBER_HERE
SEND_WEBHOOK_URL=http://YOUR_FAX_SERVER_URL:8080/fax/send
SEND_WEBHOOK_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
SEND_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
```

### 4. Install and Start the Systemd Service

Copy the provided systemd service file to `/etc/systemd/system/`:
```bash
sudo cp synergymattersfax.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

Edit the service file (`/etc/systemd/system/synergymattersfax.service`) if necessary to ensure the paths are correct:
- `WorkingDirectory` should point to the directory containing the binary (e.g., `/home/ubuntu/synergymattersfax`).
- `ExecStart` should point to the full path of the `synergymatters_fax` binary.

Reload systemd and start the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable synergymattersfax
sudo systemctl start synergymattersfax
```

### 5. Start the SFTPGo Service with Docker Compose

The SFTPGo service is managed via Docker Compose. Ensure Docker is installed and running, then execute:
```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```
This will launch SFTPGo with the following port mappings:
- Web Interface: `http://<SERVER_IP>:8081`
- FTP: Port 21
- Passive Ports: 50000-50100

On first access, configure the SFTPGo admin user and then create additional users as needed. Make sure to set each userâ€™s root directory to `/srv/sftpgo/synergyfax_ftp`.

## Accessing the Services

- **SFTPGo Web Interface:** Accessible at `http://<SERVER_IP>:8081`
- **Main Fax Service:** Operates as a backend service handling fax processing and webhook communications.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify that your `.env` file is correctly configured.
- For systemd service logs, run:
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -u synergymattersfax -f
  ```
- For Docker Compose logs:
  ```bash
  sudo docker compose logs
  ```
